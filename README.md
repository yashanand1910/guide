# Introduction
Welcome to my development guide! This is a collection of pragmatic software development best practices for developing modern applications that also focuses on developer experience, ease of deployment, versioning, maintenance, operations, etc.

Why should you trust this guide? As I have developed real applications over the years, spanning web, mobile and the desktop landscape, I have come to realize a few patterns in development that I have stuck to. These patterns are, of course, unique to my experience, but also resonate with some of the best available practices you can find online.
