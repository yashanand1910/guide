## Introduction
Welcome to my development guide! I have created this guide with the goal of 'templating' the approach that I usually take myself when developing new software.

This is a collection of pragmatic & comprehensive software development best practices for modern applications that also focuses on developer experience, ease of deployment, versioning, maintenance, operations, etc.

### Why trust this guide?
As I have developed real applications over the years, spanning web, mobile and the desktop landscape, I have come to realize a few patterns in development that I have stuck to. These patterns are, of course, unique to my experience, but also resonate with some of the best available practices you can find online.
